# Features

1. **Cercube:**

> - Block all advertisements.
>
> - Enable background playback.
>
> - Set default player quality on WiFi & Celullar.
>
> - Save videos in high resolution, save videos as audio-only, save public playlists (beta).
> 
> - Manage and share downloads to any app.
>
> - And more...

2. **iSponsorBlock:** Skips annoying sponsor ads inside videos. iSponsorBlock is based on [SponsorBlock engine](https://sponsor.ajay.app/). This is the iOS version of the SponsorBlock extension.

3. **YTABGoodies:** allow you to disable some YouTube A/B testing features. It is a combination of several tweaks, such as:

> - YouAreThere: disable "Video paused. Continue watching?" popup in the YouTube app when you play a long video.
>
> - YouRememberCaption: make YouTube remember your video caption setting (if not already).
>
> - YTNoCheckLocalNetwork: block the Local Network permission popup.
>
> - YTSystemAppearance: sync the YouTube theme (dark/light) with the system theme.

4. **YTClassicVideoQuality:** since YouTube v16.xx, you need one more step to change the video quality. YTClassicVideoQuality brings back the old video quality selector, which is a lot better than the new one.

5. **NOYTPremium:** remove YouTube Premium upsell alerts.

6. **YTUHD:** unlock VP9 codec and in effect, enables video quality of 2K and 4K. You can enable/disable YTUHD in YouTube Settings => Video quality preferences.

7. **YouPiP:** enable YouTube's **native PiP**. More options are in YouTube Settings => General.

8. **YTNoHoverCards:** offer an option to enable/disable the annoying suggested videos show up at the end of the videos.


# Known issues

1. **Cercube**: Hide Cast button is not working.

2. **iSponsorBlock**: the modified time doesn't show up in the seek bar

3. **YTUHD**: Stuttering on 4K videos (sometimes).

4. **YouPiP** (iOS 14.0 - 14.4.2): due to Apple's fault, you may encounter the *speedup-bug* as described [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NKdv1fr_KRWgD8nhkMDfG2eLBnbdeVtX/view?usp=sharing). The bug also happens when you try to play multi-sources of sound at the same time. Enable **LegacyPiP** is a workaround. Keep in mind that LegacyPiP also removes UHD quality and breaks YouTube Autoplay next. Use it at your own risk.

5. **Not a bug**: the app won't be able to receive push notifications if you use a free developer account to sideload it.

# Building (optional)

## Method 1: azule (simple way)

1. Setup [Azule](https://github.com/Al4ise/Azule) on your machine (macOS/Linux/iOS).

2. Download all the tweaks you want to inject. 

> - **[iOS Repo Updates]**(https://www.ios-repo-updates.com/) is a trust-able source. [cydownload](https://github.com/borishonman/cydownload) and [Windows Repo Tool](https://github.com/SarahH12099/Windows-Repo-Tool) are good alternative.
>
> - The sideloaded version of iSponsorBlock is here ([Luewii's fork](https://github.com/Luewii/iSponsorBlock)).

3. Run `azule` in any Terminal window and follow the instruction.

4. Select `1. Inject tweaks`, then Drag & drop the **decrypted** YouTube IPA and your prepared tweaks into the azule window. Other options are optional.

5. Done! Azule will take care of the rest!

## Method 2: theos-jailed (complex way)

1. 1. Setup [theos-jailed](https://github.com/kabiroberai/theos-jailed/wiki/Installation)

2. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/qnblackcat/CercubePlus.git
```

3. Open `Makefile` and edit the path to your decrypted YouTube IPA. 

4. Optional: Modify the app the way you want. I suggest you take a look at the [theos-jailed wiki](https://github.com/kabiroberai/theos-jailed/wiki/Usage) and my `Makefile`.

5. `cd` to the project folder, run
```
make clean package
```
